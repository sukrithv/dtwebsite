            Auditions are a laid-back, fun process, so nothing should stop you

            During audition, each dancer will be taught a short piece. After all
            auditions are submitted, the choreographers will select their
            dancers and create a weekly rehearsal schedule. We attempt to
            incorporate as many dancer conflicts as possible. Results are
            announced on Sunday evening and practices begin immediately on
            Monday!
          </p>
          <p>
            On Saturday, we will provide a video teaching a short choreography.
            Each of the choreographer will provide a video of a snippet of their
            dance, talk about their music choices and the type of dancers they
            are looking for. This process gives prospective dancers a chance to
            watch all the dances for the term and decide which to audition for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each dancer must fill out an online preference sheet. Each sheet
            will contain a ranking of the desired dances, the number of desired
            dances, as well as weekly conflicts. The preference sheet MUST be
            submitted by the audition submittion deadline (Sunday, 5:00PM).
          </p>

            Remember, this is a fun process, so do not worry about how well you
            perform! Choreographers are mostly looking for potential and dancing
            ability, not your ability to perfectly perform the audition piece,
            so just try to show off what you have, rather than worrying about
            hitting every move precisely.

            Every semester, we have over 300 people attending our showcase and

            The showcase is a mandatory event for the benefit of dancers
