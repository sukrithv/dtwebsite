                <p>
                  Founded in 1994, the MIT DanceTroupe is the largest dance organization
                  at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We are a student-run
                  group dedicated to bringing a variety of dance styles to everyone in
                  the MIT community, regardless of level. Every semester, we offer
                  various dance workshops to our members and produce one full length
                  show.

                  Members may participate in up to four dances, with one hour of weekly
                  rehearsal per dance. In addition to rehearsals, dancers must attend

                  and Production Week. Production Week occurs the week before the show
                  performances and involves several dress rehearsals.
